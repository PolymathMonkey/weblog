Hello there! I’m Dirk, a security engineer with a passion for forensics and Skateboarding. By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.
But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just a hobby - it’s my passion, my center, and my identity. For me, Skatelife is more than just a lifestyle; it’s a way of life that embodies creativity, freedom, and community. I’ve been shredding for years, and I still get that same rush every time I’m on my board.
In addition to my love for skateboarding, I’m also an enthusiast of OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there. I’ve built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat hunting, which allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of cybersecurity. There’s something about the simplicity, elegance, and power of OpenBSD that resonates deeply with me.">

<p>Hello there! I&rsquo;m Dirk, a security engineer with a passion for forensics and
Skateboarding. By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks and systems
from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
<p>But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just
a hobby - it&rsquo;s my passion, my center, and my identity. For me, Skatelife
is more than just a lifestyle; it&rsquo;s a way of life that embodies creativity,
freedom, and community. I&rsquo;ve been shredding for years, and I still get that
same rush every time I&rsquo;m on my board.</p>
<p>In addition to my love for skateboarding, I&rsquo;m also an enthusiast of
OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there. I&rsquo;ve
built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat hunting, which
allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of cybersecurity. There&rsquo;s
something about the simplicity, elegance, and power of OpenBSD that resonates
deeply with me.</p>
<p>As a self-proclaimed nerd, I have to mention my love affair with Emacs - the
most flexible, and customizable text editor out there. I&rsquo;ve been using it for
over 12 years now, and I still can&rsquo;t imagine working without it. Whether
I&rsquo;m writing code, weblogging, or just tinkering with snippets of text, Emacs
is always by my side.</p>
<p>As I navigate the world of cybersecurity, I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to
improve my skills, stay ahead of the curve, and inspire others to do the same.
And when I&rsquo;m not geeking out over security patches or network protocols, you
can find me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shredding the on my Deck (Skatelife all the way!)</li>
<li>Exploring the depths of OpenBSD and building cool stuff</li>
<li>Rocking Emacs like it&rsquo;s 2012</li>
<li>Writing about my adventures, insights, and projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on my journey as a security engineer, skateboarder,
OpenBSD enthusiast, and Zen student&quot;</p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>As a security enthusiast, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the world of
open-source operating systems. Among them, OpenBSD stands out for its
commitment to security, stability, and simplicity. But what sets it
apart from other OSes? And how does it relate to my journey with
Zen meditation?</p>
<p>At first glance, OpenBSD and Zen might seem like vastly different concepts.
One is a powerful operating system, while the other is a spiritual practice
that originated in ancient China. However, as I delved deeper into both worlds,
I discovered some intriguing commonalities.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity-and-clarity">Simplicity and Clarity</h3>
<p>OpenBSD&rsquo;s minimalist approach to software design resonates deeply with the
principles of Zen Buddhism. In Zen, simplicity is key to achieving inner
clarity and balance. By stripping away unnecessary complexity, OpenBSD aims to
create a stable and secure foundation for users. Similarly, in meditation,
simplicity helps to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment.</p>
<h3 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h3>
<p>Both OpenBSD and Zen emphasize the importance of attention to detail. In
software development, this means carefully crafting each line of code to
ensure stability and security. In Zen practice, it means paying close
attention to one&rsquo;s breath, posture, and mental state to achieve a state of
mindfulness. By focusing on these details, both OpenBSD and Zen strive for perfection.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-consistency">The Power of Consistency</h3>
<p>OpenBSD&rsquo;s commitment to consistency is evident in its codebase, where each
code change follows a code review. Zen practice, consistency is also crucial,
as it helps to establish a sense of routine and stability. By establishing
a daily meditation practice, I&rsquo;ve found that consistency is key to making
progress on my spiritual journey.</p>
<h3 id="the-beauty-of-imperfection">The Beauty of Imperfection</h3>
<p>Finally, both OpenBSD and Zen recognize the beauty in imperfection. In software
development, imperfections can often be corrected or mitigated through careful
design and testing. In Zen practice, imperfections are seen as opportunities
for growth and self-awareness. By embracing our imperfections, we can cultivate
a sense of humility and compassion.</p>
<p>As I continue on my journey with OpenBSD and Zen, I&rsquo;m struck by the ways in
which these two seemingly disparate worlds intersect. By embracing simplicity,
attention to detail, consistency, and the beauty of imperfection, both OpenBSD
and Zen offer unique insights into the nature of software development and
personal growth.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates from my adventures in the world of security,
coding, and spiritual growth!</p>
<p>Ideas for future posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;My favorite OpenBSD configuration files and tweaks&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How I use Zen principles to improve my coding workflow&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The intersection of security and spirituality: How both inform each other&rdquo;</li>

<h3 id="i-dot-introduction">I. Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="brief-overview-of-the-use-case-ingesting-web-data-into-elasticsearch-with-honeypot-httpd">Brief overview of the use case: ingesting web data into Elasticsearch with HoneyPot HTTPD</h4>
<p>I recently set out to ingest web traffic data into our SIEM solution, which
requires data to be ingested in a specific format. After researching various
options, I sought an easy-to-use solution that could integrate with our
existing Elasticsearch setup. One tool that caught my attention was
HoneyPot HTTPD.</p>
<p>As I researched potential solutions, I realized that many of them required
manual configuration and scripting to ingest web data into Elasticsearch.
However, HoneyPot HTTPD offered a simple and elegant way to do so through
its built-in ingestion feature. This was especially appealing since I wanted
to integrate the web traffic data with our existing SIEM setup that utilized
Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>In particular, I needed a tool that could collect web traffic data and forward
it to a centralized location for analysis and processing. HoneyPot HTTPD&rsquo;s
ability to ingest web data into Elasticsearch made it an attractive choice,
as it would allow me to leverage our existing Elasticsearch infrastructure
and integrate the data with our SIEM solution seamlessly.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I set out to explore how to use HoneyPot HTTPD to ingest
web traffic data into Elasticsearch. In the following sections, I&rsquo;ll walk
you through the steps I took to configure HoneyPot HTTPD for ingestion,
including the Dockerfile used to build the container and any additional
configuration settings required.</p>

<h4 id="containerizing-the-application-to-run-inside-docker">Containerizing the application to run inside docker</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a Dockerfile</p>
<p>I started by creating a Dockerfile that would build the HoneHTTPD image.
The Dockerfile included the following instructions:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>FROM ubuntu:latest
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Install necessary dependencies</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RUN apt-get update <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install -y python3-pip
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Install required packages</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RUN pip3 install honeyhttpd
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Set working directory to /usr/local/bin</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>WORKDIR /usr/local/bin
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EXPOSE <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Copy configuration file</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>COPY config.yaml /etc/honeyhttpd/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Run HoneyPot HTTPD</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>CMD <span style="color:#f92672">[</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;honeyhttpd&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;-c&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/etc/honeyhttpd/config.yaml&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">]</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this Dockerfile, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used the official Ubuntu image as the base image</li>
<li>Installed necessary dependencies, including Python and pip</li>
<li>Installed the required packages, including HoneyPot HTTPD</li>
<li>Set the working directory to /usr/local/bin to run the application from</li>
<li>Exposed port 80 for HTTP traffic</li>
<li>Copied the configuration file (config.yaml) into the container</li>
<li>Specified the command to run HoneyPot HTTPD with the -c option, which points</li>
<li>to the configuration file</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building and Running the Container</p>
<p>Once I had created the Dockerfile, I built the image by running
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker build -t honeyhttpd .</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command told Docker to create an image with the tag honeyhttpd using
the instructions in the Dockerfile.To run the container, I used
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker run -p 80:80 honeyhttpd</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command started a new container from the honeyhttpd image and mapped
port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the container.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuring the Container</p>
<p>To configure the container, I updated the config.yaml file to point to
my Elasticsearch instance. Here&rsquo;s an example of what the configuration
file might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>-ingest:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_host: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;localhost:9200&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_index: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;logstash-2019.04&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_type: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;log&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This configuration told HoneyPot HTTPD to forward web traffic data to
my Elasticsearch instance, where it could be processed and stored.</p>
<p>With the container running and configured, I was now ready to test
HoneyPot HTTPD&rsquo;s ability to ingest web traffic data into Elasticsearch.</p>
