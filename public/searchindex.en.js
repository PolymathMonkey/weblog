By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.\nBut when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just a hobby - it’s my passion, my center, and my identity. For me, Skatelife is more than just a lifestyle; it’s a way of life that embodies creativity, freedom, and community. I’ve been shredding for years, and I still get that same rush every time I’m on my board.\nIn addition to my love for skateboarding, I’m also an enthusiast of OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there. I’ve built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat hunting, which allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of cybersecurity. There’s something about the simplicity, elegance, and power of OpenBSD that resonates deeply with me.\nAs a self-proclaimed nerd, I have to mention my love affair with Emacs - the most flexible, and customizable text editor out there. I’ve been using it for over 12 years now, and I still can’t imagine working without it. Whether I’m writing code, weblogging, or just tinkering with snippets of text, Emacs is always by my side.\nAs I navigate the world of cybersecurity, I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills, stay ahead of the curve, and inspire others to do the same. And when I’m not geeking out over security patches or network protocols, you can find me:\nShredding the on my Deck (Skatelife all the way!) Exploring the depths of OpenBSD and building cool stuff Rocking Emacs like it’s 2012 Writing about my adventures, insights, and projects Stay tuned for more updates on my journey as a security engineer, skateboarder, OpenBSD enthusiast, and Zen student\"",
