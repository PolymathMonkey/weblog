<p>Course description from SANS <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOR608: Enterprise-Class Incident Response &amp; Threat Hunting focuses
on identifying and responding to incidents too large to focus on
individual machines. By using example tools built to operate at
enterprise-class scale, students learn the techniques to collect
focused data for incident response and threat hunting, and dig
into analysis methodologies to learn multiple approaches to
understand attacker movement and activity across hosts of varying
functions and operating systems by using an array of analysis techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="brief-overview-of-forensic-analysis-and-its-application">Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application</h3>
<p>Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to
solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments,
it involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key applications
include incident response, compliance with regulations, investigations,
and predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Tools like Timesketch, Velociraptor or Wireshark, and cloud forensics platforms aid in the
analysis. Collaboration between IT and law enforcement is also crucial for
successful investigations.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The goal of forensic analysis is to reconstruct events, identify perpetrators,
and determine damage extent, ensuring organizations can respond effectively
to security threats and maintain compliance with regulations.</p>
<h2 id="course-overview"><strong>Course Overview</strong></h2>
<h3 id="proactive-detection-and-response--608-dot-1">Proactive Detection and Response (608.1)</h3>
<p>The FOR608 course begins in chapter 1 by discussing current cyber defense concerns
and the importance of collaboration among incident responders and threat
hunters. It emphasizes the need for sharing knowledge from sources like
the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> framework and explores the concept of active defense,
including the use of honeypots, honey tokens, and canaries to slow down
attackers and facilitate detection.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When a compromise does occur, the course focuses on efficient handling of
intrusions, covering topics such as leading the response, managing team
members, documenting findings, and communicating with stakeholders. The
<a href="https://github.com/cyb3rfox/Aurora-Incident-Response" rel="external" target="_blank">Aurora</a> documentation tool is introduced as a means for tracking investigation
phases from initial detection to remediation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The chapter then dives into an example scenario where an alert is triggered in
a company network, and triage data is analyzed using <a href="https://timesketch.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Timesketch</a>, a powerful
platform for scalable and collaborative analysis of forensic data.
Additionally, techniques are shared for viewing the same data set with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" rel="external" target="_blank">Kibana</a>,
which offers capabilities such as creating dashboards and saved searches to aid
analysis.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Chapter 608.1 concludes by examining key threat intelligence concepts, including
developing and implementing internal threat intelligence. External projects
like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma" rel="external" target="_blank">Sigma</a> are leveraged, and two comprehensive threat intel
platforms, <a href="https://www.misp-project.org" rel="external" target="_blank">MISP</a> and <a href="https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/" rel="external" target="_blank">OpenCTI</a>, are introduced. A threat intel report on the
adversary targeting Stark Research Labs is presented to kick off the
investigation into potential signs of intrusion in the company.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-response-and-analysis--608-dot-2">Scaling Response and Analysis (608.2)</h3>
<p>The course continues from chapter 1 by focusing on response actions.
Students learn how to collect evidence at scale to scope a potential intrusion
by leveraging EDR tooling data from EDR Solutions like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon" rel="external" target="_blank">Sysmon</a>. However, they
also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use to evade EDR
technology.To aid in this analysis, the <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> tool is introduced
as a powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The chapter shows how <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> can collect forensic artifacts from across
the enterprise and provide deep-dive capabilities into individual hosts
of interest. Additionally, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch" rel="external" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> is used to ingest and process data
from various tools, allowing for fast searches and aggregations. Students
also learn about rapid response options for targeted data collections at

<h2 id="i-dot-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="brief-overview-of-the-use-case-ingesting-web-data-into-elasticsearch-with-honeypot-httpd">Brief overview of the use case: ingesting web data into Elasticsearch with HoneyPot HTTPD</h3>
<p>I recently set out to ingest web traffic data into our SIEM solution, which
requires data to be ingested in a specific format. After researching various
options, I sought an easy-to-use solution that could integrate with our
existing Elasticsearch setup. One tool that caught my attention was
HoneyPot HTTPD.</p>
<p>As I researched potential solutions, I realized that many of them required
manual configuration and scripting to ingest web data into Elasticsearch.
However, HoneyPot HTTPD offered a simple and elegant way to do so through
its built-in ingestion feature. This was especially appealing since I wanted
to integrate the web traffic data with our existing SIEM setup that utilized
Elasticsearch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In particular, I needed a tool that could collect web traffic data and forward
it to a centralized location for analysis and processing. HoneyPot HTTPD&rsquo;s
ability to ingest web data into Elasticsearch made it an attractive choice,
as it would allow me to leverage our existing Elasticsearch infrastructure
and integrate the data with our SIEM solution seamlessly.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With this in mind, I set out to explore how to use HoneyPot HTTPD to ingest
web traffic data into Elasticsearch. In the following sections, I&rsquo;ll walk
you through the steps I took to configure HoneyPot HTTPD for ingestion,
including the Dockerfile used to build the container and any additional
configuration settings required.</p>

<h3 id="containerizing-the-application-to-run-inside-docker">Containerizing the application to run inside docker</h3>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a Dockerfile</p>
<p>I started by creating a Dockerfile that would build the HoneHTTPD image.
The Dockerfile included the following instructions:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>FROM ubuntu:latest
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Install necessary dependencies</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RUN apt-get update <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install -y python3-pip
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Install required packages</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>RUN pip3 install honeyhttpd
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Set working directory to /usr/local/bin</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>WORKDIR /usr/local/bin
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EXPOSE <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Copy configuration file</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>COPY config.yaml /etc/honeyhttpd/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Run HoneyPot HTTPD</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>CMD <span style="color:#f92672">[</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;honeyhttpd&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;-c&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/etc/honeyhttpd/config.yaml&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">]</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this Dockerfile, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used the official Ubuntu image as the base image</li>
<li>Installed necessary dependencies, including Python and pip</li>
<li>Installed the required packages, including HoneyPot HTTPD</li>
<li>Set the working directory to /usr/local/bin to run the application from</li>
<li>Exposed port 80 for HTTP traffic</li>
<li>Copied the configuration file (config.yaml) into the container</li>
<li>Specified the command to run HoneyPot HTTPD with the -c option, which points</li>
<li>to the configuration file</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building and Running the Container</p>
<p>Once I had created the Dockerfile, I built the image by running
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker build -t honeyhttpd .</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command told Docker to create an image with the tag honeyhttpd using
the instructions in the Dockerfile.To run the container, I used
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker run -p 80:80 honeyhttpd</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command started a new container from the honeyhttpd image and mapped
port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the container.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuring the Container</p>
<p>To configure the container, I updated the config.yaml file to point to
my Elasticsearch instance. Here&rsquo;s an example of what the configuration
file might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>-ingest:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_host: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;localhost:9200&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_index: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;logstash-2019.04&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>es_type: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;log&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This configuration told HoneyPot HTTPD to forward web traffic data to
my Elasticsearch instance, where it could be processed and stored.</p>
<p>With the container running and configured, I was now ready to test
HoneyPot HTTPD&rsquo;s ability to ingest web traffic data into Elasticsearch.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>As a security enthusiast, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the world of
open-source operating systems. Among them, OpenBSD stands out for its
commitment to security, stability, and simplicity. But what sets it
apart from other OSes? And how does it relate to my journey with
Zen meditation?</p>
<p>At first glance, OpenBSD and Zen might seem like vastly different concepts.
One is a powerful operating system, while the other is a spiritual practice
that originated in ancient China. However, as I delved deeper into both worlds,
I discovered some intriguing commonalities.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity-and-clarity">Simplicity and Clarity</h2>
<p>OpenBSD&rsquo;s minimalist approach to software design resonates deeply with the
principles of Zen Buddhism. In Zen, simplicity is key to achieving inner
clarity and balance. By stripping away unnecessary complexity, OpenBSD aims to
create a stable and secure foundation for users. Similarly, in meditation,
simplicity helps to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment.</p>
<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>Both OpenBSD and Zen emphasize the importance of attention to detail. In
software development, this means carefully crafting each line of code to
ensure stability and security. In Zen practice, it means paying close
attention to one&rsquo;s breath, posture, and mental state to achieve a state of
mindfulness. By focusing on these details, both OpenBSD and Zen strive for perfection.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-consistency">The Power of Consistency</h2>
<p>OpenBSD&rsquo;s commitment to consistency is evident in its codebase, where each
code change follows a code review. Zen practice, consistency is also crucial,
as it helps to establish a sense of routine and stability. By establishing
a daily meditation practice, I&rsquo;ve found that consistency is key to making
progress on my spiritual journey.</p>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-imperfection">The Beauty of Imperfection</h2>
<p>Finally, both OpenBSD and Zen recognize the beauty in imperfection. In software
development, imperfections can often be corrected or mitigated through careful
design and testing. In Zen practice, imperfections are seen as opportunities
for growth and self-awareness. By embracing our imperfections, we can cultivate
a sense of humility and compassion.</p>
<p>As I continue on my journey with OpenBSD and Zen, I&rsquo;m struck by the ways in
which these two seemingly disparate worlds intersect. By embracing simplicity,
attention to detail, consistency, and the beauty of imperfection, both OpenBSD
and Zen offer unique insights into the nature of software development and
personal growth.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates from my adventures in the world of security,
coding, and spiritual growth!</p>
