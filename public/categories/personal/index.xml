      <description>Abbildung 1: Which is this crazy guy?&#xA;I am a teacher assistant at the University of Granada, specialised in Artificial Intelligence. As many people, I have several roles:&#xA;Since a researcher side, I have a index-h of 15, with more than 24 papers (more than 90% in Q1), with more than 3000 citations. In the main menu, you can see my publications (in many case with the PDF freely available, ask me if you need any other). Also, I am currently the Chair on the IEEE CIS Task Force on Large-Scale Global Optimization, because it is a type of optimization I am particularly interested (I was winner in two international competitions, at 2010 and more recently at 2018).</description>
