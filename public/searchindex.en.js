This environment allows me to safely observe attacks and develop detection and defense methods. I deployed web and shell honeypots, and collect real threat data in a controlled setting.\nIt‚Äôs a practical, hands-on way to explore the behavior of adversaries and its a lot of fun!\nNetwork Setup Basic Topology, Hardware and Tools üõ† For the hardware setup, I kept things lightweight and affordable by using Raspberry Pi devices and open-source tools. The honeypot is based on the well-known Cowrie SSH honeypot and the Honeyhttpd HTTP honeypot. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM, hosted inside a Docker üê≥ container. On the honeypot host, Filebeat is running to ingest the Cowrie logs into the ELK stack.\nFor the ELK stack, I used a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM, running Debian. The ELK services are also containerized using Docker. The stack is based on the DShield SIEM project, which I customized to better fit my needs. I‚Äôll dive deeper into those modifications and the ELK setup in a follow-up article.\nThe network topology is straightforward but deliberately segmented. The router is connected to a managed switch, which is responsible for handling VLAN separation. Both the honeypot and the ELK server are connected to this switch and are placed in an isolated VLAN (VLAN210). This VLAN is dedicated exclusively to threat hunting, ensuring that any potentially malicious traffic remains fully contained and cannot interfere with the rest of the home network.\nA client system üíª is the only machine allowed to connect from outside the VLAN to both the ELK server and the honeypot. This connection is strictly for maintenance and administrative purposes. The ELK server is allowed to access the internet, primarily to pull threat intelligence data from external sources and security feeds.\nIn contrast, the honeypot is completely blocked from internet access, with the exception of SSH and HTTP traffic going in and out of it. These are the only services deliberately exposed to simulate vulnerable endpoints. Communication between the honeypot and the ELK server is allowed for log ingestion and analysis. However, I intend to introduce stricter controls on this internal traffic in the future to further reduce the attack surface.\nFirewall configurationüß± For the pf(1) configuration It was as always with UNIX fairly easy to get to work:\nmatch in quick log on egress proto tcp from any to any port 22 flags S/SA rdr-to $honeypot port 2222 This rule makes sure any incoming TCP connection attempt to port 22 (SSH) is immediately intercepted, logged, and transparently redirected to the $honeypot server listening on port 2222.\nSwitch configuration What I Learned Building and maintaining this lightweight honeypot and monitoring setup on Raspberry Pi devices has been an insightful experience. Here are some key takeaways:\nResource Efficiency: Raspberry Pis provide a surprisingly capable platform for running complex services like Cowrie honeypot and the ELK stack in Docker containers, keeping costs and power consumption low.\nNetwork Segmentation Matters: Isolating the honeypot and ELK server in a dedicated VLAN (VLAN210) effectively contains malicious traffic, protecting the rest of the home network from potential threats.\nControlled Access Is Crucial: Restricting external access to only authorized clients and limiting the honeypot‚Äôs internet connectivity reduces the attack surface while still enabling useful data collection.\nLogging and Data Collection: Using Filebeat to ship logs from the honeypot to the ELK stack provides real-time visibility into attacker behavior, which is essential for threat hunting and incident response.\nCustomization Pays Off: Adapting existing tools and SIEM projects (like DShield) to specific needs improves effectiveness and allows for tailored threat detection.\nFuture Improvements: There is always room to tighten internal communication rules and harden the setup further to minimize risk and improve operational security.\nThis project highlights the balance between practical constraints and security needs, demonstrating that even modest hardware can contribute significantly to threat intelligence and network defense.\nI drew inspiration for this setup from the DShield SIEM project by SANS and would like to express my gratitude for their valuable work.\nWhats next Next I had to build the ssh honeypot and the HTTP honeypot, stay tuned for the follow up!",

By using example tools built to operate at enterprise-class scale, students learn the techniques to collect focused data for incident response and threat hunting, and dig into analysis methodologies to learn multiple approaches to understand attacker movement and activity across hosts of varying functions and operating systems by using an array of analysis techniques.\nIntroduction Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key applications include incident response, compliance with regulations, investigations, and predictive analytics.\nTools like Timesketch, Velociraptor or Wireshark, and cloud forensics platforms aid in the analysis. Collaboration between IT and law enforcement is also crucial for successful investigations.\nThe goal of forensic analysis is to reconstruct events, identify perpetrators, and determine damage extent, ensuring organizations can respond effectively to security threats and maintain compliance with regulations.\nCourse Overview Proactive Detection and Response (608.1) The FOR608 course start with discussing current cyber defense concerns and the importance of collaboration among incident responders and threat hunters. There is a emphasize to use to shared knowledge from sources like the MITREATT\u0026CK framework and further explores the concept of active defense, like the use of honeypots, honey tokens, and canaries to slow down attackers and facilitate detection.\nFor case of a compromise, the materials focus on efficiently handling of intrusions, by covering topics such as leading the response, managing team members, documenting findings, and communicating with stakeholders.\nAurora documentation tool is introduced as a means for tracking the investigation phases from initial detection to remediation.\nLater chapter dives into a scenario where an alert gets triggered in a company network, then in the labs triage data is analyzed using Timesketch, a powerful platform for scalable and collaborative analysis of forensic data.\nAdditionally, techniques are shared for visualising the same data set with Kibana, which offers capabilities such as creating dashboards and saved searches to aid analysis.\nThe Chapter concludes by examining key threat intelligence concepts, including developing and implementing internal threat intelligence. External projects like MITRE ATT\u0026CK and Sigma are leveraged, and two comprehensive threat intel platforms, MISP and OpenCTI, are introduced.\nA threat intel report on the adversary targeting Stark Research Labs is used for intelligence to kick off the investigation into potential signs of intrusion in the company.\nScaling Response and Analysis (608.2) The course continues from chapter 1 by focusing on response actions. The Instructors show how to collect evidence at scale to scope a potential intrusion by leveraging EDR tooling data from EDR Solutions like Sysmon.\nHowever, they also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use to evade EDR technology. To aid in this analysis, Velociraptor is introduced as a powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.\nThen the chapter continuses to show how Velociraptor can collect forensic artifacts from across the enterprise and provide deep-dive capabilities into individual hosts of interest. Additionally, Elasticsearch is used to ingest and process data from various tools, allowing for fast searches and aggregations. I also learned about rapid response options for targeted data collections at scale using tools like Velociraptor and CyLR. Finally, we got solutions shown that are used for quickly processing acquired data for analysis in tools like Timesketch and individual artifact review.\nModern Attacks against Windows and Linux DFIR (608.3) In the third chapter of the course the focus shifts from network-based analysis to classic host-based forensic artifact analysis. The start is to discuss modern attack techniques on Windows systems, including the infamous ransomware and ‚Äúliving-of-the-land‚Äù (LOTB) attacks that avoid detection by using built-in binaries and scripts.\nThe use of Sigma rules is highlighted as a way to facilitate rapid detection and response.\nThe chapter covers Linux incident response and analysis too, by starting with common vulnerabilities and exploits targeting Linux systems. Then it dives into DFIR fundamentals on Linux systems, including key concepts such as differences among Linux distributions and filesystems, and strategies for handling initial triage and deeper forensic analysis. The chapter concludes by providing best practices for hardening Linux systems and enhancing logging configurations to aid future investigations.\nAnalyzing macOS and Docker Containers (608.4) Now the focus went on to Apple macOS incident response, building on the foundation we got established earlier. This part includes understanding the history, ecosystem, and details of the Apple Filesystem (APFS), file structure, and important file types such as Property List (plist) configuration files. A discussion of challenges and opportunities in responding to macOS incidents follows, covering topics like acquiring disk and triage data, reviewing acquisitions, and identifying suspicious activity in logs and artifacts.\nThis part of the course then transitions to containerized microservices and Docker analysis, focusing on the architecture and management of Docker containers and providing a specific triage workflow for quick and effective response against individual containers as well as the container host.\nCloud Attacks and Response (608.5) This part focused on incident response in major cloud platforms from Microsoft and Amazon, covering log analysis techniques, architecture designs, and automation initiatives that can be applied across various cloud providers. It highlights unique challenges and opportunities in cloud environments, particularly through the use of the MITRE ATT\u0026CK framework‚Äôs Cloud Matrix.\nIn-depth discussion follows on Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure, including popular SaaS offerings like Entra ID, Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams, as well as common attack scenarios against these platforms. The importance of log analysis is emphasized strongly, particularly in identifying suspicious user logon and email activity from Unified Audit Logs.\nThe course then addresses the Recovery phase, covering security enhancements to detect or prevent similar attacks in the future for M365 and Azure.\nNext, it delves into Amazon Web Services (AWS), covering its general architecture and components, as well as numerous logs and services providing critical detection and analysis data for responders. Discussions focus on architecting for response in the cloud, including setting up security accounts for a secure enclave within AWS, using template VMs (AMIs) for analysis, and automating IR tasks with AWS Lambda and Step Functions.\nCapstone: Enterprise-Class IR Challenge The final section of the course is the capstone exercise that allows students to apply their knowledge by working on a simulated breach scenario. They will receive a dataset from a compromised environment that spans multiple host operating systems and cloud environments, and use tools and techniques learned throughout the course to uncover the steps of the breach.\nKey Takeaways Summary of key concepts and skills learned during the course During the SANS FOR608 course, I learned concepts and skills that enabled me to do more effective incident response and coordination, including enterprise-level incident detection and to deploy threat hunting strategies. The course covered large-scale event correlation and timeline analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in incidents, as well as multi-platform artifact analysis for incident response.\nSpecifically, I gained hands-on experience analyzing artifacts from various platforms, including Windows devices, Linux systems, macOS devices, containerized environments, and cloud-based infrastructure. This comprehensive training has equipped me with the knowledge and tools needed to detect, analyze, and respond to complex threats in enterprise environments.\nThe most fun was the parts where we learned about Timesketch and Velociraptor, I think each of those tools individually is extremely powerful, but when you integrate them into your threathunting / Response stack I thing they are of great benefit.\nlearning outcomes and their application in real-world scenarios Based on the provided course materials, I have analyzed my learning outcomes and their application in real-world scenarios. Through my analysis, I have gained a deeper understanding of the key concepts and skills required for effective cloud response and analysis, container DFIR fundamentals, detecting modern attacks, enterprise incident response management, enterprise visibility and incident scoping, foundational cloud concepts, Linux DFIR fundamentals, macOS DFIR fundamentals, macOS essentials, rapid response triage at scale.\nI have also gained practical knowledge of how to correlate large volumes of data to identify patterns and trends in incidents.\nIn particular, my experience with cloud-based infrastructure has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of foundational cloud concepts, including popular cloud services that enterprises use to support business operations. I have also gained familiarity with common data source types in an enterprise environment and strategies to aggregate telemetry from disparate resources.\nMy analysis of learning outcomes suggests that effective application of these skills requires a combination of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and communication skills. By mastering these skills, I am confident in my ability to respond effectively to complex incidents and provide value to organizations as a security professional.\nConclusion and Recommendations Summary of overall effectiveness of the SANS Forensics course for608 SANS FOR608 course is a comprehensive training program which provides responders with a strong foundation in incident response, threat hunting, and digital forensic analysis.
