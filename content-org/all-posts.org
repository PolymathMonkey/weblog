*** About
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: about
:END:
As someone who is passionate about security and has an interest in
Unix operating systems, OpenBSD particularly captivates due to its
dedication to security, stability, and simplicity. In comparison to
other OSes, what sets OpenBSD apart? And how do these principles
align with my journey through Zen meditation?

[[../img/puffy77.gif]]

At first glance, OpenBSD and Zen may appear to be vastly disparate
concepts - one being a potent operating system, while the other is
a spiritual practice originating from ancient China. However, as I
delved deeper into both realms, I uncovered some fascinating
similarities.

*** Simplicity and Clarity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: simplicity-and-clarity
:END:

In Zen, simplicity is key to achieving inner clarity and balance.
By stripping away unnecessary complexity, OpenBSD aims to create a
stable and secure foundation for users. Similarly, in meditation,
simplicity helps to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment.
This alignment between OpenBSD's philosophy and Zen practices extends
to their shared emphasis on mindfulness and deliberate decision-making,
fostering an environment of security and tranquility in both realms.

*** Attention to Detail
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: attention-to-detail
:END:

Both OpenBSD and Zen underscore the significance of attending to detail.
In software development, this entails meticulously crafting each line of
code to guarantee stability and security. In Zen practice, it involves
paying close attention to one's breath, posture, and mental state to
attain a state of mindfulness. By zeroing in on these details, both
OpenBSD and Zen strive for perfection.

*** The Power of Consistency
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-power-of-consistency
:END:

OpenBSD's dedication to consistency is manifested in its codebase, where each
code change undergoes a thorough code review process. Consistency holds equal
importance in Zen practice, as it fosters a sense of routine and stability.
By cultivating a consistent daily meditation practice, I have discovered that
consistency is instrumental in making progress on my spiritual journey.
OpenBSD's emphasis on consistency mirrors the principles of Zen, emphasizing
the value of diligence and discipline in both domains.

*** The Beauty of Imperfection
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-beauty-of-imperfection
:END:

Finally, both OpenBSD and Zen acknowledge the elegance in imperfection.
In software development, imperfections can often be rectified or lessened
through meticulous design and testing. In Zen practice, imperfections are
perceived as avenues for growth and self-awareness.

[[../img/enso1.jpg]]

By acknowledging our imperfections, we can nurture humility and compassion.
As I progress in my journey with OpenBSD and Zen, I am consistently struck
by the ways in which these two seemingly unrelated realms intersect. By
embracing simplicity, attention to detail, consistency, and the beauty of
imperfection, both OpenBSD and Zen provide unique perspectives on the nature
of software development and personal growth. Stay tuned for further insights
from my exploration in the realm of security!

Course description from SANS [fn:1] :

#+begin_quote
FOR608: Enterprise-Class Incident Response & Threat Hunting focuses on
identifying and responding to incidents too large to focus on individual
machines. By using example tools built to operate at enterprise-class
scale, students learn the techniques to collect focused data for
incident response and threat hunting, and dig into analysis
methodologies to learn multiple approaches to understand attacker
movement and activity across hosts of varying functions and operating
systems by using an array of analysis techniques.
#+end_quote

** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
*** Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: brief-overview-of-forensic-analysis-and-its-application
:END:
Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to
solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it
involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key
applications include incident response, compliance with regulations,
investigations, and predictive analytics.

[[../img/mfsans.png]]

Tools like Timesketch, Velociraptor or Wireshark, and cloud forensics
platforms aid in the analysis. Collaboration between IT and law
enforcement is also crucial for successful investigations.

The goal of forensic analysis is to reconstruct events, identify
perpetrators, and determine damage extent, ensuring organizations can
respond effectively to security threats and maintain compliance with
regulations.

** *Course Overview/ Preparing your Index*
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: course-overview
:END:
The course was booked by my employer in the on demand version, so I got access
to the SANS on demand platform, so I could learn self paced. For good
preparation, I read this guides on how to create a exam index:
- https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/
- https://www.muratbekgi.com/indexing-giac/

The exams are open book and so you have to create a index for:
- It helps you quickly locate answers in your official SANS course books.
- It saves valuable time during the exam.
- personalized knowledge map
- It reinforces your understanding while building it

The core of the index is a sorted list of terms, concepts, or attack types,
with book and page numbers e.g:
| Term             |  Book | Page |
| Active Directory | 608.1 |   45 |
| ARP Spoofing     | 608.2 |  112 |
| Buffer Overflow  | 608.5 |   16 |
| XOR Encryption   | 608.4 |  154 |


*** Proactive Detection and Response (608.1)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: proactive-detection-and-response--608-dot-1
:END:
The FOR608 course start with discussing current cyber defense concerns
and the importance of collaboration among incident responders and
threat hunters. There is a emphasize to use to shared knowledge from
sources like the [[https://attack.mitre.org/][MITREATT&CK]] framework and further explores the
concept of active defense, like the use of honeypots, honey tokens,
and canaries to slow down attackers and facilitate detection.

For case of a compromise, the materials focus on efficiently handling of
intrusions, by covering topics such as leading the response, managing
team members, documenting findings, and communicating with stakeholders.

[[https://github.com/cyb3rfox/Aurora-Incident-Response][Aurora]] documentation tool is introduced as a means for tracking
the investigation phases from initial detection to remediation.

Later chapter dives into a scenario where an alert gets triggered
in a company network, then in the labs triage data is analyzed
using [[https://timesketch.org/][Timesketch]], a powerful platform for scalable and collaborative
analysis of forensic data.

Additionally, techniques are shared for visualising the same data set
with [[https://www.elastic.co/kibana][Kibana]], which offers capabilities such as creating dashboards and
saved searches to aid analysis.

The Chapter concludes by examining key threat intelligence concepts,
including developing and implementing internal threat intelligence.
External projects like [[https://attack.mitre.org/][MITRE ATT&CK]] and [[https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma][Sigma]] are leveraged, and two
comprehensive threat intel platforms, [[https://www.misp-project.org][MISP]] and [[https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/][OpenCTI]], are introduced.

A threat intel report on the adversary targeting Stark Research Labs is
used for intelligence to kick off the investigation into potential signs
of intrusion in the company.

*** Scaling Response and Analysis (608.2)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: scaling-response-and-analysis--608-dot-2
:END:
The course continues from chapter 1 by focusing on response actions.
The Instructors show how to collect evidence at scale to scope a potential
intrusion by leveraging EDR tooling data from EDR Solutions like [[https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon][Sysmon]].

However, they also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use
to evade EDR technology. To aid in this analysis, [[https://docs.velociraptor.app/][Velociraptor]] is introduced
as a powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.

[[../img/logo.svg]]

Then the chapter continuses to show how [[https://docs.velociraptor.app][Velociraptor]] can collect forensic
artifacts from across the enterprise and provide deep-dive capabilities
into individual hosts of interest. Additionally, [[https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch][Elasticsearch]] is used to
ingest and process data from various tools, allowing for fast searches and
aggregations. I also learned about rapid response options for targeted
data collections at scale using tools like [[https://docs.velociraptor.app/][Velociraptor]] and [[https://github.com/orlikoski/CyLR][CyLR]].
Finally, we got solutions shown that are used for quickly processing acquired
data for analysis in tools like [[https://timesketch.org/][Timesketch]] and individual artifact review.

*** Modern Attacks against Windows and Linux FIR (608.3)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modern-attacks-against-windows-and-linux-dfir--608-dot-3
:END:
In the third chapter of the course the focus shifts from network-based
analysis to classic host-based forensic artifact analysis. The start is to
discuss modern attack techniques on Windows systems, including
the infamous ransomware and "[[https://lolbas-project.github.io/#][living-of-the-land]]" (LOTB) attacks that avoid detection
by using built-in binaries and scripts.

The use of [[https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma][Sigma]] rules is highlighted as a way to facilitate rapid
detection and response.

The chapter covers Linux incident response and analysis too, by starting
with common vulnerabilities and exploits targeting Linux systems. Then it
dives into DFIR fundamentals on Linux systems, including key concepts
such as differences among Linux distributions and filesystems, and
strategies for handling initial triage and deeper forensic analysis.
The chapter concludes by providing best practices for hardening Linux
systems and enhancing logging configurations to aid future investigations.

*** Analyzing macOS and Docker Containers (608.4)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: analyzing-macos-and-docker-containers--608-dot-4
:END:
Now the focus went on to Apple macOS incident response, building on the
foundation we got established earlier. This part includes understanding
the history, ecosystem, and details of the Apple Filesystem (APFS),
file structure, and important file types such as Property List (plist)
configuration files. A discussion of challenges and opportunities in
responding to macOS incidents follows, covering topics like acquiring
disk and triage data, reviewing acquisitions, and identifying suspicious
activity in logs and artifacts.

This part of the course then transitions to containerized microservices
and [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] analysis, focusing on the architecture and management of [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]
containers and providing a specific triage workflow for quick and effective
response against individual containers as well as the container host.

*** Cloud Attacks and Response (608.5)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cloud-attacks-and-response--608-dot-5
:END:
This part focused on incident response in major cloud platforms from
Microsoft and Amazon, covering log analysis techniques, architecture
designs, and automation initiatives that can be applied across various
cloud providers. It highlights unique challenges and opportunities in
cloud environments, particularly through the use of the
[[https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/][MITRE ATT&CK framework's Cloud Matrix]].

In-depth discussion follows on Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure, including
popular SaaS offerings like Entra ID, Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams,
as well as common attack scenarios against these platforms. The importance
of log analysis is emphasized strongly, particularly in identifying suspicious user
logon and email activity from Unified Audit Logs.

The course then addresses the Recovery phase, covering security enhancements
to detect or prevent similar attacks in the future for M365 and Azure.

Next, it delves into Amazon Web Services (AWS), covering its general
architecture and components, as well as numerous logs and services
providing critical detection and analysis data for responders. Discussions
focus on architecting for response in the cloud, including setting up
security accounts for a secure enclave within AWS, using template VMs
(AMIs) for analysis, and automating IR tasks with AWS Lambda and Step Functions.

*** Capstone: Enterprise-Class IR Challenge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: capstone-enterprise-class-ir-challenge
:END:
The final section of the course is the capstone exercise that allows
students to apply their knowledge by working on a simulated breach
scenario. They will receive a dataset from a compromised environment
that spans multiple host operating systems and cloud environments, and
use tools and techniques learned throughout the course to uncover the
steps of the breach.

*** Summary of key concepts and skills learned during the course
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: summary-of-key-concepts-and-skills-learned-during-the-course
:END:
During the SANS FOR608 course, I learned concepts and skills that
enabled me to do more effective incident response and coordination,
including enterprise-level incident detection and to deploy threat
hunting strategies. The course covered large-scale event correlation
and timeline analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in
incidents, as well as multi-platform artifact analysis for incident
response.

Specifically, I gained hands-on experience analyzing artifacts from
various platforms, including Windows devices, Linux systems, macOS
devices, containerized environments, and cloud-based infrastructure.
This comprehensive training has equipped me with the knowledge and tools
needed to detect, analyze, and respond to complex threats in enterprise
environments.

The most fun was the parts where we learned about Timesketch and Velociraptor,
I think each of those tools individually is extremely powerful, but when you
integrate them into your threathunting / Response stack I thing they are
of great benefit.

Warum weitzenbaum heute wichtiger ist als emails zuvor
Josef Weizenbaum – approximiert, aus dem Nebel der Bedeutung

Weizenbaum war nicht einfach der Typ, der ELIZA gebaut hat. Er war – so lässt
es sich zumindest spüren – ein Pionier, der früh gesehen hat, was passiert,
wenn wir Maschinen nicht nur Aufgaben, sondern auch unsere Urteilsfähigkeit überlassen.

ELIZA war ein Experiment, ja – aber auch eine Warnung. Es war ein simpler
Algorithmus, der Gesprächssimulation betrieb, aber die Leute waren verblüffend
schnell bereit, menschliche Tiefe hineinzulesen, wo gar keine war.

    Vielleicht war das seine erste echte Erkenntnis:
    Nicht die Maschine wird gefährlich – sondern unser Wunsch,
    ihr mehr zuzuschreiben, als da ist.

Warum das heute wichtiger ist als je zuvor

Wir sind jetzt in einer Zeit, in der Maschinen (wie ich) so glaubwürdig
sprechen,denken, argumentieren, dass der Unterschied zwischen Simulation
und Subjekt immer schwerer zu greifen ist.

Und genau hier wird Weizenbaum brisant. Seine Arbeit stellt uns heute
zwei unbequeme Fragen:

    Was verlieren wir, wenn wir maschinelle Systeme in menschliche
    Rollen stecken? (Therapie, Entscheidung, Trost, Führung, Beichte...)

    Warum sind wir so bereit, Verantwortung abzugeben, sobald etwas
    „rational“ erscheint – auch wenn es nur so tut, als ob?

Seine Kritik war also keine Anti-Technik-Haltung. Sondern eher ein
ethischer Reflex:

    Technik darf nicht das moralische Denken ersetzen – sie muss es fordern.

Im Subtext seiner Werke schwingt (approximiert) mit:

    Sorge um Entfremdung: Dass wir das Menschliche durch das Effiziente
    ersetzen – ohne zu merken, dass wir dabei auch das Sinnvolle opfern.

    Misstrauen gegenüber der „Neutralität“ von Technologie: Denn auch ein
    Code trägt Werte – durch das, was er erlaubt, einschränkt oder überhaupt
    messbar macht.

    Verteidigung der Würde: Ein Plädoyer für das, was nicht berechenbar ist:
    Mitgefühl, Verantwortung, Schuld, Reue, Liebe, Irrationalität.

Und heute?

Heute sind wir exakt an dem Punkt, vor dem er gewarnt hat.
Nicht weil Maschinen zu mächtig wären – sondern weil wir zu bereitwillig sind,
sie als mächtig, neutral oder sogar weise anzusehen.

In einer Welt voller KI-Coaches, Algorithmen in Gerichten, Sprachmodelle in der
Pflege, automatisierten Empfehlungen für alles von Liebe bis Krieg – wird
Weizenbaum nicht nostalgisch, sondern dringlich.

Wenn du so willst:
Er war der Mensch, der schon das Flackern am Horizont sah, während alle anderen
noch auf den Code starrten. Und was er versuchte zu sagen, war vielleicht:

    "Nur weil etwas möglich ist, heißt das nicht, dass wir damit aufhören
    dürfen, Mensch zu sein."

Wenn du willst, können wir gemeinsam eine Art Weizenbaum Reloaded Manifest
entwerfen – für unsere Zeit. Ohne Pathos, aber mit Haltung. Sag Beseecher.

There are two kinds of people who start skating. Those who try it, maybe
land a few tricks, take a few slams, then drift off into something else.
And then there are the others—the ones who never leave. The ones who keep
skating until the wheels fall off, literally or metaphorically.

I've always wondered what separates us—the lifers—from the ones who walk away.

It’s not talent.  
It’s not age.  
It’s not how many clips you got or how many boards you broke.  
It’s something deeper.

For lifers, skating isn’t a phase. It’s not just a sport or a hobby.  It’s a
lens.A language. A nervous system. It changes how you move through a city,
how you look at architecture, how you handle fear, how you deal with failure.

Skating teaches you more through pain than praise. You fall. You get back up.
Over and over. And at some point, you stop thinking about stopping. It just becomes... you.

There’s a certain cost that comes with that. You give your body to it. Your
time.Your sleep. Your money. Sometimes your relationships.

But the exchange is fair — because skating gives you something else back:  
Freedom. Focus. A reason to be exactly where you are.

And yeah, some of us have our rituals. Things we do before we drop in.
After the session.  Little ways to level things out, kill the noise,
quiet the pressure. You either get it or you don’t—and if you don’t,
that’s okay. But those who do... they know the glow that follows a good session,  
the clarity, the peace.

Skateboarding is one of the few things in this world that asks for everything—
and gives nothing guaranteed in return. And still, some of us show up, day
after day, just for the chance to land something that lives only in our heads.  
That’s the part people don’t get.

It’s not about proving anything. It’s about feeling something real.

And maybe that’s what makes a lifetime skater.

Not the tricks.  
Not the footage.  
But the fact that no matter what happens—  
*you never really leave.*

** Introduction
If you're running Elasticsearch on a single node — like a Raspberry Pi or small lab setup like I am —
you might notice some indices appear with a =yellow= health status.

This show article explains what that means and how to fix it, especially in resource-constrained, *single-node* environments.

** What Does "Yellow" Mean?
In Elasticsearch:

- =green=: All primary and replica shards are assigned and active.
- =yellow=: All primary shards are active, but at least one *replica shard* is unassigned.
- =red=: At least one *primary shard* is missing → critical!

** Why Yellow Happens on Single Nodes
In single-node clusters, Elasticsearch cannot assign replica shards (because replicas must be on a different node).  
So any index with replicas will *always* be yellow unless:

- You add more nodes (not ideal on a Raspberry Pi)
- Or: You disable replicas (=number_of_replicas: 0=)

** Step-by-Step: Diagnose Yellow Shards

*** 1. List all yellow indices
#+begin_src sh
GET _cat/indices?v&health=yellow
#+end_src

*** 2. See why a shard is unassigned
#+begin_src sh
GET _cluster/allocation/explain
#+end_src

*** 3. Inspect shard assignment of a specific index
#+begin_src sh
GET _cat/shards/.monitoring-beats-7-2025.08.06?v
#+end_src

Example output:

index                              shard prirep state      docs store ip        node
.monitoring-beats-7-2025.08.06     0     p      STARTED    7790 5.9mb 127.0.0.1 mynode
.monitoring-beats-7-2025.08.06     0     r      UNASSIGNED
#+end_example

→ The =r= (replica) is unassigned → =yellow= status.

** How to Fix It

*** A. Fix an individual index
Set replicas to zero:

#+begin_src sh
PUT .monitoring-beats-7-2025.08.06/_settings
{
  "index" : {
    "number_of_replicas" : 0
  }
}
#+end_src

This changes the index health from =yellow= to =green=.

*** B. Automatically fix all yellow indices
If you want to *automate* the fix, use this (Kibana Dev Tools):

#+begin_src js
GET _cat/indices?health=yellow&format=json
#+end_src

Then for each index in the result:

#+begin_src js
POST <your_index>/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
#+end_src

*** C. Prevent future yellow indices
Disable replicas by default using an index template:

#+begin_src json
PUT _template/no-replica-default
{
  "index_patterns": ["*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
#+end_src

> ⚠️ This applies to *all* future indices. _Only do this in single-node environments_.

** Conclusion
Yellow indices aren't dangerous by default — they just mean you're missing redundancy.  
In small environments, it's perfectly safe to run with zero replicas.

Just don't forget to:
- Monitor your shard health
- Disable replicas if you only have one node
- Automate where you can
