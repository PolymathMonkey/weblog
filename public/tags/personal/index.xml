      <description>Introduction Requirements Installing Monit on OpenBSD Monit – Essential System and Router Services System monitoring runs every 45 seconds. The first check is delayed by 120 seconds to avoid overloading the system immediately after boot.&#xA;set daemon 45 with start delay 120 Monit logs to syslog. `idfile` and `statefile` store Monit’s persistent state and identity across restarts.&#xA;set log syslog set idfile /var/monit/id set statefile /var/monit/state Limits control buffer sizes and timeouts for program outputs, network I/O, and service start/stop/restart operations. This prevents Monit from hanging or processing excessive data.</description>

      <description>Introduction So I had this USB Disk attached to my OpenBSD Router used as storage, one saturday when I was walking by I noticed the weird clicking sounds from the disk. So I knew my time was running before the disc would fail.&#xA;Curiously, when I plugged the same drive into a Linux box, it was detected and even showed a valid OpenBSD partition table. That gave me a glimmer of hope: maybe the hardware wasn’t completely dead yet.</description>
