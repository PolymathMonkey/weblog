:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: brief-overview-of-forensic-analysis-and-its-application
:END:
Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to
solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it
involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key
applications include incident response, compliance with regulations,
investigations, and predictive analytics.

[[../img/mfsans.png]]

Tools like Timesketch, Velociraptor or Wireshark, and cloud forensics
platforms aid in the analysis. Collaboration between IT and law
enforcement is also crucial for successful investigations.

The goal of forensic analysis is to reconstruct events, identify
perpetrators, and determine damage extent, ensuring organizations can
respond effectively to security threats and maintain compliance with
regulations.

** *Course Overview*
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: course-overview
:END:
*** Proactive Detection and Response (608.1)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: proactive-detection-and-response--608-dot-1
:END:
The FOR608 course start with discussing current cyber defense concerns
and the importance of collaboration among incident responders and
threat hunters. There is a emphasize to use to shared knowledge from
sources like the [[https://attack.mitre.org/][MITREATT&CK]] framework and further explores the
concept of active defense, like the use of honeypots, honey tokens,
and canaries to slow down attackers and facilitate detection.

For case of a compromise, the materials focus on efficiently handling of
intrusions, by covering topics such as leading the response, managing
team members, documenting findings, and communicating with stakeholders.

[[https://github.com/cyb3rfox/Aurora-Incident-Response][Aurora]] documentation tool is introduced as a means for tracking
the investigation phases from initial detection to remediation.

Later chapter dives into a scenario where an alert gets triggered
in a company network, then in the labs triage data is analyzed
using [[https://timesketch.org/][Timesketch]], a powerful platform for scalable and collaborative
analysis of forensic data.

Additionally, techniques are shared for visualising the same data set
with [[https://www.elastic.co/kibana][Kibana]], which offers capabilities such as creating dashboards and
saved searches to aid analysis.

The Chapter concludes by examining key threat intelligence concepts,
including developing and implementing internal threat intelligence.
External projects like [[https://attack.mitre.org/][MITRE ATT&CK]] and [[https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma][Sigma]] are leveraged, and two
comprehensive threat intel platforms, [[https://www.misp-project.org][MISP]] and [[https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/][OpenCTI]], are introduced.

A threat intel report on the adversary targeting Stark Research Labs is
used for intelligence to kick off the investigation into potential signs
of intrusion in the company.

*** Scaling Response and Analysis (608.2)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: scaling-response-and-analysis--608-dot-2
:END:
The course continues from chapter 1 by focusing on response actions.
The Instructors show how to collect evidence at scale to scope a potential
intrusion by leveraging EDR tooling data from EDR Solutions like [[https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon][Sysmon]].

However, they also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use
to evade EDR technology. To aid in this analysis, [[https://docs.velociraptor.app/][Velociraptor]] is introduced
as a powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.

[[../img/logo.svg]]

Then the chapter continuses to show how [[https://docs.velociraptor.app][Velociraptor]] can collect forensic
artifacts from across the enterprise and provide deep-dive capabilities
into individual hosts of interest. Additionally, [[https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch][Elasticsearch]] is used to
ingest and process data from various tools, allowing for fast searches and
aggregations. I also learned about rapid response options for targeted
data collections at scale using tools like [[https://docs.velociraptor.app/][Velociraptor]] and [[https://github.com/orlikoski/CyLR][CyLR]].
Finally, we got solutions shown that are used for quickly processing acquired
data for analysis in tools like [[https://timesketch.org/][Timesketch]] and individual artifact review.

*** Modern Attacks against Windows and Linux DFIR (608.3)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modern-attacks-against-windows-and-linux-dfir--608-dot-3

analysis to classic host-based forensic artifact analysis. The start is to
discuss modern attack techniques on Windows systems, including
the infamous ransomware and "[[https://lolbas-project.github.io/#][living-of-the-land]]" (LOTB) attacks that avoid detection
by using built-in binaries and scripts.

The use of [[https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma][Sigma]] rules is highlighted as a way to facilitate rapid
detection and response.

The chapter covers Linux incident response and analysis too, by starting
with common vulnerabilities and exploits targeting Linux systems. Then it
dives into DFIR fundamentals on Linux systems, including key concepts
such as differences among Linux distributions and filesystems, and
strategies for handling initial triage and deeper forensic analysis.
The chapter concludes by providing best practices for hardening Linux
systems and enhancing logging configurations to aid future investigations.

*** Analyzing macOS and Docker Containers (608.4)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: analyzing-macos-and-docker-containers--608-dot-4
:END:
Now the focus went on to Apple macOS incident response, building on the
foundation we got established earlier. This part includes understanding
the history, ecosystem, and details of the Apple Filesystem (APFS),
file structure, and important file types such as Property List (plist)
configuration files. A discussion of challenges and opportunities in
responding to macOS incidents follows, covering topics like acquiring
disk and triage data, reviewing acquisitions, and identifying suspicious
activity in logs and artifacts.

This part of the course then transitions to containerized microservices
and [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] analysis, focusing on the architecture and management of [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]
containers and providing a specific triage workflow for quick and effective
response against individual containers as well as the container host.

*** Cloud Attacks and Response (608.5)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cloud-attacks-and-response--608-dot-5
:END:
This part focused on incident response in major cloud platforms from
Microsoft and Amazon, covering log analysis techniques, architecture
designs, and automation initiatives that can be applied across various
cloud providers. It highlights unique challenges and opportunities in
cloud environments, particularly through the use of the
[[https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/][MITRE ATT&CK framework's Cloud Matrix]].

In-depth discussion follows on Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure, including
popular SaaS offerings like Entra ID, Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams,
as well as common attack scenarios against these platforms. The importance
of log analysis is emphasized strongly, particularly in identifying suspicious user
logon and email activity from Unified Audit Logs.

The course then addresses the Recovery phase, covering security enhancements
to detect or prevent similar attacks in the future for M365 and Azure.

Next, it delves into Amazon Web Services (AWS), covering its general
architecture and components, as well as numerous logs and services
providing critical detection and analysis data for responders. Discussions
focus on architecting for response in the cloud, including setting up
security accounts for a secure enclave within AWS, using template VMs
(AMIs) for analysis, and automating IR tasks with AWS Lambda and Step Functions.

*** Capstone: Enterprise-Class IR Challenge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: capstone-enterprise-class-ir-challenge
:END:
The final section of the course is the capstone exercise that allows
students to apply their knowledge by working on a simulated breach
scenario. They will receive a dataset from a compromised environment
that spans multiple host operating systems and cloud environments, and
use tools and techniques learned throughout the course to uncover the
steps of the breach.

** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
*** Brief overview of the use case
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: brief-overview-of-the-use-case
:END:
I recently set out to ingest web traffic data into my SIEM solution,
which requires data to be ingested in a specific format. After
researching various options, I sought an easy-to-use solution that could
integrate with our existing Elasticsearch setup. One tool that caught my
attention was HoneyPot HTTPD.

As I researched potential solutions, I realized that many of them
required manual configuration and scripting to ingest web data into
Elasticsearch. However, HoneyPot HTTPD offered a simple and elegant way
to do so through its built-in ingestion feature. This was especially
appealing since I wanted to integrate the web traffic data with our
existing SIEM setup that utilized Elasticsearch.

In particular, I needed a tool that could collect web traffic data and
forward it to a centralized location for analysis and processing.
HoneyPot HTTPD's ability to ingest web data into Elasticsearch made it
an attractive choice, as it would allow me to leverage our existing
Elasticsearch infrastructure and integrate the data with our SIEM
solution seamlessly.

With this in mind, I set out to explore how to use HoneyPot HTTPD to
ingest web traffic data into Elasticsearch. In the following sections,
I'll walk you through the steps I took to configure HoneyPot HTTPD for
ingestion, including the Dockerfile used to build the container and any
additional configuration settings required.

** Setting up HoneyPot HTTPD for Web Data Ingestion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: setting-up-honeypot-httpd-for-web-data-ingestion
:END:
*** Containerizing the application to run inside docker
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: containerizing-the-application-to-run-inside-docker
:END:

- Creating a Dockerfile

  I started by creating a Dockerfile that would build the HoneHTTPD
  image. The Dockerfile included the following instructions:

  #+begin_src sh
  FROM ubuntu:latest
  # Install necessary dependencies
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip
  # Install required packages
  RUN pip3 install honeyhttpd
  # Set working directory to /usr/local/bin
  WORKDIR /usr/local/bin
  # Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
  EXPOSE 80
  # Copy configuration file
  COPY config.yaml /etc/honeyhttpd/
  # Run HoneyPot HTTPD
  CMD ["honeyhttpd", "-c", "/etc/honeyhttpd/config.yaml"]
  #+end_src

  In this Dockerfile, I:

  - Used the official Ubuntu image as the base image
  - Installed necessary dependencies, including Python and pip
  - Installed the required packages, including HoneyPot HTTPD
  - Set the working directory to /usr/local/bin to run the application
    from
  - Exposed port 80 for HTTP traffic
  - Copied the configuration file (config.yaml) into the container
  - Specified the command to run HoneyPot HTTPD with the -c option,
    which points
  - to the configuration file

- Building and Running the Container

  Once I had created the Dockerfile, I built the image by running the
  following command:

  #+begin_src sh
  docker build -t honeyhttpd .
  #+end_src

  This command told Docker to create an image with the tag honeyhttpd
  using the instructions in the Dockerfile.To run the container, I used
  the following command:

  #+begin_src sh
  docker run -p 80:80 honeyhttpd
  #+end_src

  This command started a new container from the honeyhttpd image and
  mapped port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the container.

- Configuring the Container

  To configure the container, I updated the config.yaml file to point to
  my Elasticsearch instance. Here's an example of what the configuration
  file might look like:

  #+begin_src sh
  -ingest:
  es_host: "localhost:9200"
  es_index: "logstash-2019.04"
  es_type: "log"
  #+end_src

  This configuration told HoneyPot HTTPD to forward web traffic data to
  my Elasticsearch instance, where it could be processed and stored.

  With the container running and configured, I was now ready to test
  HoneyPot HTTPD's ability to ingest web traffic data into
  Elasticsearch.
