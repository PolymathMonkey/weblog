:END:

I used to believe that the place I worked for meant something.  
That our mission was shared. That our values were real.  
That if you showed up with honesty, effort, and a willingness to carry more than your share —  
you’d be met with respect. Or at least, fairness.

I was wrong.

** Disappointment
What hurts isn’t the exit itself.  
What hurts is realizing that the foundation I stood on  
was never really there at all.  
That the culture I believed in — the one I helped build —  
was, in the end, just an image.  

That when things got hard,  
the masks stayed on, and  
the people I trusted turned away.

** The Pull to React
For a while, I wanted to fight.  
Not because I love conflict,  
but because the silence felt like betrayal.

I wanted to prove something.  
To show them they were wrong about me.  
To remind them that I was worth more than the way they let me go.

But I’ve chosen a different path.

** Stillness
I won’t drag names through the mud.  
I won’t post receipts or pass around whispers.  
Not because they deserve protection —  
but because I deserve peace.

What I build next will be louder than anything I could say.

** What Comes Next
I have ideas.  
Good ones.  
Open source, threat hunting on a budget, monitoring stacks that actually work,  
stories about real resilience in the face of bullshit.

I know what I’ve built.  
I know what I can offer.  
And I’ll keep showing up — not for them,  
but for the part of me that never wanted to be anything but real.

** Final Note
To those who watched in silence as I burned —  
I hope the quiet served you well.

To those who ever believed in me —  
I’m still here.

And to myself —  
This is where it begins again. With truth, and with clarity.
