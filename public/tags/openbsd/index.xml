      <description>About As someone who is passionate about security and has an interest in Unix operating systems, OpenBSD particularly captivates due to its dedication to security, stability, and simplicity. In comparison to other OSes, what sets OpenBSD apart? And how do these principles align with my journey through Zen meditation?&#xA;At first glance, OpenBSD and Zen may appear to be vastly disparate concepts - one being a potent operating system, while the other is a spiritual practice originating from ancient China. However, as I delved deeper into both realms, I uncovered some fascinating similarities.</description>

      <description>Introduction Requirements Installing Monit on OpenBSD Monit – Essential System and Router Services System monitoring runs every 45 seconds. The first check is delayed by 120 seconds to avoid overloading the system immediately after boot.&#xA;set daemon 45 with start delay 120 Monit logs to syslog. `idfile` and `statefile` store Monit’s persistent state and identity across restarts.&#xA;set log syslog set idfile /var/monit/id set statefile /var/monit/state Limits control buffer sizes and timeouts for program outputs, network I/O, and service start/stop/restart operations. This prevents Monit from hanging or processing excessive data.</description>

      <description>Introduction So I had this USB Disk attached to my OpenBSD Router used as storage, one saturday when I was walking by I noticed the weird clicking sounds from the disk. So I knew my time was running before the disc would fail.&#xA;Curiously, when I plugged the same drive into a Linux box, it was detected and even showed a valid OpenBSD partition table. That gave me a glimmer of hope: maybe the hardware wasn’t completely dead yet.</description>
