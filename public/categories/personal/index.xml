      <description>Hi! I’m Dirk, a security engineer with a passion for Skateboarding and Forensics. By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.&#xA;But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just my hobby - it’s my passion, my center, and my identity. For me, Skatelife is more than just lifestyle; it’s a way of life that embodies creativity, freedom, and community and Family. I’ve been skating for years, and I still get that same feel every time I’m on my board.</description>
