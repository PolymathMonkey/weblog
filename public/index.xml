      <description>What Burned Me Built Me I used to believe that the place I worked for meant something. That our mission was shared. That our values were real. That if you showed up with honesty, effort, and a willingness to carry more than your share — you’d be met with respect. Or at least, fairness.&#xA;I was wrong.&#xA;Disappointment What hurts isn’t the exit itself. What hurts is realizing that the foundation I stood on was never really there at all. That the culture I believed in — the one I helped build — was, in the end, just an image.</description>
