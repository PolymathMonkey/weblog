    <description>Abbildung 1: What is this about?&#xA;Hello there! I’m [Your Name], a seasoned security engineer with a passion for protecting people and their digital lives. By day, I help organizations safeguard their networks and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.&#xA;But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just a hobby - it’s my passion, my sanctuary, and my identity. For me, Skatelife is more than just a lifestyle; it’s a way of life that embodies creativity, freedom, and community. I’ve been shredding the gnar for years, and I still get that same rush every time I’m on my board.&#xA;In addition to my love for skateboarding, I’m also an enthusiast of OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there. I’ve built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat hunting, which allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of cybersecurity. There’s something about the simplicity, elegance, and power of OpenBSD that resonates deeply with me.</description>
