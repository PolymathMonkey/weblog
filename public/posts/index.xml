      <description>Introduction If you’re running Elasticsearch on a single node — like a Raspberry Pi or small lab setup — you might notice some indices appear with a yellow health status.&#xA;This article explains what that means and how to fix it, especially in resource-constrained, single-node environments.&#xA;What Does “Yellow” Mean? In Elasticsearch:&#xA;green: All primary and replica shards are assigned and active. yellow: All primary shards are active, but at least one replica shard is unassigned. red: At least one primary shard is missing → critical!

So any index with replicas will always be yellow unless:</description>
