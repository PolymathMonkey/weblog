Hi, I’m Dirk — a security engineer with a deep passion for skateboarding and
digital forensics. I help my company protect networks and systems against
evolving cybersecurity threats through a mix of technical expertise and
continuous learning.

Skateboarding is more than a hobby to me; it’s a source of creativity, freedom,
and community. It shapes how I approach challenges — with persistence, balance,
and a mindset open to innovation.

Beyond that, I’m an [[https://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]] enthusiast. I’ve built an OpenBSD-based router and
threat-hunting infrastructure to stay ahead in cybersecurity. I appreciate
OpenBSD for its simplicity, security, and elegance — qualities I strive to
bring to my work.

I’m also a longtime [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] user, relying on it daily for coding, writing, and
organizing my thoughts. It’s part of how I stay productive and focused.

In cybersecurity, I’m committed to continuous growth and adapting to new
challenges. When I’m not working on security projects, you’ll find me skating or
exploring new ideas inspired by Zen philosophy.

You can download my [[file:~/org/forensicwheels/static/downloads/DirkCV_encrypted.pdf][CV]] as a [[file:~/org/forensicwheels/static/downloads/DirkCV.pdf.sig][signed]] and encrypted PDF for authenticity and
privacy. If you need the password to decrypt it,
please send me an [[mailto:polymathmonkey@keksmafia.org][E-mail]]

Stay tuned for updates on my journey as a security engineer, skateboarder, and
lifelong learner.
