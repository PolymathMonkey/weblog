FOR608: Enterprise-Class Incident Response &amp; Threat Hunting focuses on identifying and responding to incidents too large to focus on individual machines. By using example tools built to operate at enterprise-class scale, students learn the techniques to collect focused data for incident response and threat hunting, and dig into analysis methodologies to learn multiple approaches to understand attacker movement and activity across hosts of varying functions and operating systems by using an array of analysis techniques.
Introduction Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key applications include incident response, compliance with regulations, investigations, and predictive analytics.">

also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use to evade EDR
technology.To aid in this analysis, the <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> tool is introduced
as a powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.</p>
<p>The chapter shows how <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> can collect forensic artifacts from across
the enterprise and provide deep-dive capabilities into individual hosts
of interest. Additionally, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch" rel="external" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> is used to ingest and process data
from various tools, allowing for fast searches and aggregations. Students
also learn about rapid response options for targeted data collections at
scale using tools like <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orlikoski/CyLR" rel="external" target="_blank">CyLR</a>. Finally, solutions are presented
for quickly processing acquired data for analysis in tools like  <a href="https://timesketch.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Timesketch</a>
and individual artifact review.</p>
<h3 id="modern-attacks-against-windows-and-linux-dfir--608-dot-3">Modern Attacks against Windows and Linux DFIR (608.3)</h3>
<p>The third chapter of the course shifts focus from network-based analysis to
traditional host-based forensic artifact analysis. It begins by discussing
modern attack techniques on Windows systems, including ransomware and
&ldquo;<a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">living-of-the-land</a>&rdquo; (LOTB) attacks that avoid detection by using built-in
binaries and scripts. The use of <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma" rel="external" target="_blank">Sigma</a> rules is highlighted as a way to
facilitate rapid detection and response.</p>
<p>The section also covers Linux incident response and analysis, starting with
common vulnerabilities and exploits targeting Linux systems. It then dives
into DFIR fundamentals for analyzing Linux systems, including key concepts
such as differences among Linux distributions and file systems, and
strategies for handling initial triage and deeper forensic analysis.
The chapter concludes by providing best practices for hardening Linux
systems and enhancing logging configurations to aid future investigations.</p>
<h3 id="analyzing-macos-and-docker-containers--608-dot-4">Analyzing macOS and Docker Containers (608.4)</h3>
