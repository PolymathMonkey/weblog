      <description>I. Introduction Brief overview of the use case: ingesting web data into Elasticsearch with HoneyPot HTTPD I recently set out to ingest web traffic data into our SIEM solution, which requires data to be ingested in a specific format. After researching various options, I sought an easy-to-use solution that could integrate with our existing Elasticsearch setup. One tool that caught my attention was HoneyPot HTTPD.</description>

      <description>Abbildung 1: What is this about?&#xA;Hello there! I’m Dirk, a security engineer with a passion for forensics and Skateboarding. By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape.&#xA;But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not just a hobby - it’s my passion, my center, and my identity. For me, Skatelife is more than just a lifestyle; it’s a way of life that embodies creativity, freedom, and community. I’ve been shredding for years, and I still get that same rush every time I’m on my board.&#xA;In addition to my love for skateboarding, I’m also an enthusiast of OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there. I’ve built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat hunting, which allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of cybersecurity. There’s something about the simplicity, elegance, and power of OpenBSD that resonates deeply with me.</description>

      <description>About Simplicity and Clarity Attention to Detail The Power of Consistency The Beauty of Imperfection About As a security enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by the world of open-source operating systems. Among them, OpenBSD stands out for its commitment to security, stability, and simplicity. But what sets it apart from other OSes? And how does it relate to my journey with Zen meditation?</description>

      <description>Enterprise Threat hunting and Response (FOR608) Introduction Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application Course Overview Proactive Detection and Response (608.1) Scaling Response and Analysis (608.2) Modern Attacks against Windows and Linux DFIR (608.3) Analyzing macOS and Docker Containers (608.4) Cloud Attacks and Response (608.5) Capstone: Enterprise-Class IR Challenge Key Takeaways Summary of key concepts and skills learned during the course Analysis of learning outcomes and their application in real-world scenarios Conclusion and Recommendations Summary of overall effectiveness of the SANS Forensics course for608 Recommendations for future students looking to learn forensic analysis skills Gain Practical Experience Develop Your Analytical Skills Learn about Cloud Computing Familiarize Yourself with Linux and macOS Join Online Communities Consider Specializing in a Specific Area Stay Up-to-Date with Industry Developments Enterprise Threat hunting and Response (FOR608) Course description from SANS 1 :&#xA;FOR608: Enterprise-Class Incident Response &amp; Threat Hunting focuses on identifying and responding to incidents too large to focus on individual machines. By using example tools built to operate at enterprise-class scale, students learn the techniques to collect focused data for incident response and threat hunting, and dig into analysis methodologies to learn multiple approaches to understand attacker movement and activity across hosts of varying functions and operating systems by using an array of analysis techniques.&#xA;Introduction Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key applications include incident response, compliance with regulations, investigations, and predictive analytics.</description>
