<h2 id="enterprise-threat-hunting-and-response--for608"><strong>Enterprise Threat hunting and Response (FOR608)</strong></h2>
<p>Course description from SANS <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOR608: Enterprise-Class Incident Response &amp; Threat Hunting focuses on
identifying and responding to incidents too large to focus on individual
machines. By using example tools built to operate at enterprise-class
scale, students learn the techniques to collect focused data for
incident response and threat hunting, and dig into analysis
methodologies to learn multiple approaches to understand attacker
movement and activity across hosts of varying functions and operating
systems by using an array of analysis techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="brief-overview-of-forensic-analysis-and-its-application">Brief overview of forensic analysis and its application</h3>
<p>Forensic analysis in computer science investigates digital evidence to
solve cybercrimes and security incidents. In enterprise environments, it
involves analyzing devices, networks, and cloud storage. Key
applications include incident response, compliance with regulations,
investigations, and predictive analytics.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tools like Timesketch, Velociraptor or Wireshark, and cloud forensics
platforms aid in the analysis. Collaboration between IT and law
enforcement is also crucial for successful investigations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The goal of forensic analysis is to reconstruct events, identify
perpetrators, and determine damage extent, ensuring organizations can
respond effectively to security threats and maintain compliance with
regulations.</p>
<h2 id="course-overview"><strong>Course Overview</strong></h2>
<h3 id="proactive-detection-and-response--608-dot-1">Proactive Detection and Response (608.1)</h3>
<p>The FOR608 course begins in chapter 1 by discussing current cyber
defense concerns and the importance of collaboration among incident
responders and threat hunters. It emphasizes the need for sharing
knowledge from sources like the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">MITRE
ATT&amp;CK</a> framework and explores the concept of active defense, including
the use of honeypots, honey tokens, and canaries to slow down attackers
and facilitate detection.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When a compromise does occur, the course focuses on efficient handling
of intrusions, covering topics such as leading the response, managing
team members, documenting findings, and communicating with stakeholders.
The <a href="https://github.com/cyb3rfox/Aurora-Incident-Response" rel="external" target="_blank">Aurora</a>
documentation tool is introduced as a means for tracking investigation
phases from initial detection to remediation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The chapter then dives into an example scenario where an alert is
triggered in a company network, and triage data is analyzed using
<a href="https://timesketch.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Timesketch</a>, a powerful platform for
scalable and collaborative analysis of forensic data. Additionally,
techniques are shared for viewing the same data set with
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" rel="external" target="_blank">Kibana</a>, which offers capabilities
such as creating dashboards and saved searches to aid analysis.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Chapter 608.1 concludes by examining key threat intelligence concepts,
including developing and implementing internal threat intelligence.
External projects like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma" rel="external" target="_blank">Sigma</a> are leveraged, and two
comprehensive threat intel platforms,
<a href="https://www.misp-project.org" rel="external" target="_blank">MISP</a> and
<a href="https://filigran.io/solutions/open-cti/" rel="external" target="_blank">OpenCTI</a>, are introduced. A
threat intel report on the adversary targeting Stark Research Labs is
presented to kick off the investigation into potential signs of
intrusion in the company.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-response-and-analysis--608-dot-2">Scaling Response and Analysis (608.2)</h3>
<p>The course continues from chapter 1 by focusing on response actions.
Students learn how to collect evidence at scale to scope a potential
intrusion by leveraging EDR tooling data from EDR Solutions like
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon" rel="external" target="_blank">Sysmon</a>.
However, they also discuss common bypass techniques that attackers use
to evade EDR technology.To aid in this analysis, the
<a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> tool is introduced as a
powerful platform for incident response and threat hunting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&lt;!&ndash;more&ndash;&gt;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The chapter shows how <a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a>
can collect forensic artifacts from across the enterprise and provide
deep-dive capabilities into individual hosts of interest. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch" rel="external" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> is used to
ingest and process data from various tools, allowing for fast searches
and aggregations. Students also learn about rapid response options for
targeted data collections at scale using tools like
<a href="https://docs.velociraptor.app/" rel="external" target="_blank">Velociraptor</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/orlikoski/CyLR" rel="external" target="_blank">CyLR</a>. Finally, solutions are
presented for quickly processing acquired data for analysis in tools
like <a href="https://timesketch.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Timesketch</a> and individual artifact
review.</p>
<h3 id="modern-attacks-against-windows-and-linux-dfir--608-dot-3">Modern Attacks against Windows and Linux DFIR (608.3)</h3>
<p>The third chapter of the course shifts focus from network-based analysis
to traditional host-based forensic artifact analysis. It begins by
discussing modern attack techniques on Windows systems, including
ransomware and
