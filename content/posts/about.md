Hello there! I'm Dirk, a security engineer with a passion for forensics
and Skateboarding. By day, I help my Company safeguard their networks
and systems from the ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity
landscape.

But when the sun goes down, my true self emerges. Skateboarding is not
just a hobby - it's my passion, my center, and my identity. For me,
Skatelife is more than just a lifestyle; it's a way of life that
embodies creativity, freedom, and community. I've been shredding for
years, and I still get that same rush every time I'm on my board.

In addition to my love for skateboarding, I'm also an enthusiast of
OpenBSD - the most secure, yet accessible operating system out there.
I've built my own OpenBSD-based router and infrastructure for threat
hunting, which allows me to stay one step ahead in the game of
cybersecurity. There's something about the simplicity, elegance, and
power of OpenBSD that resonates deeply with me.

As a self-proclaimed nerd, I have to mention my love affair with Emacs -
the most flexible, and customizable text editor out there. I've been
using it for over 12 years now, and I still can't imagine working
without it. Whether I'm writing code, weblogging, or just tinkering with
snippets of text, Emacs is always by my side.

As I navigate the world of cybersecurity, I'm always looking for ways to
improve my skills, stay ahead of the curve, and inspire others to do the
same. And when I'm not geeking out over security patches or network
protocols, you can find me:

-   Shredding the on my Deck (Skatelife all the way!)
-   Exploring the depths of OpenBSD and building cool stuff
-   Rocking Emacs like it's 2012
-   Writing about my adventures, insights, and projects

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey as a security engineer,
skateboarder, OpenBSD enthusiast, and Zen student‚Äù
