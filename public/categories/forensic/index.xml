      <description>Introduction So I had this USB Disk attached to my OpenBSD Router used as storage, one saturday when I was walking by I noticed the weird clicking sounds from the disk. So I knew my time was running before the disc would fail.&#xA;Curiously, when I plugged the same drive into a Linux box, it was detected — and even showed a valid OpenBSD partition table. That gave me a glimmer of hope: maybe the hardware wasn’t completely dead yet.</description>
