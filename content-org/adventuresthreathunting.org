** Introduction

This is a small series I wanted to start, where I write about my small
threathunting setup and describe a little what I build and what I am doing
with it.

In this part, I will describe the Network setup for my Environment, more about
how I build the honeypots and the ELK Server I will describe in the follow up
articles about threathunting.

Keep in mind this is for Education and fun, no serious stuff going on here.

*** Why I Built a Home Lab for Threat Hunting  üïµ
The threat landscape is constantly evolving, with new attack vectors, tools,
and tactics appearing almost daily.  

And to keep my skills current with real-world threats, I built a home lab dedicated
to threat hunting. This environment allows me to safely observe attacks and
develop detection and defense methods. I deployed web and shell honeypots,
and collect real threat data in a controlled setting.

It‚Äôs a practical, hands-on way to explore the behavior of adversaries and its a
lot of fun!

** Network Setup
*** Basic Topology, Hardware and Tools üõ†

[[../img/mynet.png]]

For the **hardware setup**, I kept things lightweight and affordable by using
Raspberry Pi devices and open-source tools. The honeypot is based on the
well-known **Cowrie SSH honeypot** and the **Honeyhttpd HTTP honeypot**.
It runs on a **Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM**, hosted inside a Docker üê≥
container. On the honeypot host, **Filebeat** is running to ingest the Cowrie
logs into the ELK stack. @@comment: Write about honeypot setup @@

For the **ELK stack**, I used a **Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM**, running
Debian. The ELK services are also containerized using Docker. The stack is
based on the **DShield SIEM project**, which I customized to better fit
my needs. I‚Äôll dive deeper into those modifications and the ELK setup in
a follow-up article.

The network topology is straightforward but deliberately segmented. The router
is connected to a **managed switch**, which is responsible for handling VLAN
separation. Both the honeypot and the ELK server are connected to this switch
and are placed in an **isolated VLAN (VLAN210)**. This VLAN is dedicated
exclusively to **threat hunting**, ensuring that any potentially malicious
traffic remains fully contained and cannot interfere with the rest of the
home network.

A **client system** üíª is the only machine allowed to connect **from outside the
VLAN** to both the ELK server and the honeypot. This connection is strictly
for **maintenance and administrative purposes**. The ELK server is allowed to
access the **internet**, primarily to pull **threat intelligence data** from
external sources and security feeds.

In contrast, the **honeypot** is completely **blocked from internet access**,
with the exception of **SSH and HTTP traffic** going in and out of it. These
are the only services deliberately exposed to simulate vulnerable endpoints.
Communication between the honeypot and the ELK server is allowed for log
ingestion and analysis. However, I intend to introduce **stricter controls** on
this internal traffic in the future to further reduce the attack surface.

*** Firewall configurationüß± @@comment: don't forget to add the HTTP pf rule@@
For the pf(1) configuration It was as always with UNIX fairly easy to get to work:
#+begin_src sh
  match in quick log on egress proto tcp from any to any port 22 flags S/SA rdr-to $honeypot port 2222
#+end_src

This rule makes sure any incoming TCP connection attempt to port 22 (SSH) is immediately
intercepted, logged, and transparently redirected to the $honeypot server
listening on port 2222.@@comment: Link to article with full ruleset@@

*** Switch configuration
@@comment: TBD@@

** What I Learned
Building and maintaining this lightweight honeypot and monitoring setup on
Raspberry Pi devices has been an insightful experience. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Resource Efficiency**: Raspberry Pis provide a surprisingly capable
  platform for running complex services like Cowrie honeypot and the ELK stack
  in Docker containers, keeping costs and power consumption low.

- **Network Segmentation Matters**: Isolating the honeypot and ELK server in a
  dedicated VLAN (VLAN210) effectively contains malicious traffic, protecting
  the rest of the home network from potential threats.

- **Controlled Access Is Crucial**: Restricting external access to only
  authorized    clients and limiting the honeypot's internet connectivity
  reduces the attack surface while still enabling useful data collection.

- **Logging and Data Collection**: Using Filebeat to ship logs from the
  honeypot to the ELK stack provides real-time visibility into attacker
  behavior, which is essential for threat hunting and incident response.

- **Customization Pays Off**: Adapting existing tools and SIEM projects
  (like DShield) to specific needs improves effectiveness and allows for
  tailored threat detection.

- **Future Improvements**: There is always room to tighten internal
  communication rules and harden the setup further to minimize risk and
  improve operational security.

This project highlights the balance between practical constraints and security
needs, demonstrating that even modest hardware can contribute significantly
to threat intelligence and network defense.

I drew inspiration for this setup from the DShield SIEM project by SANS and
would like to express my gratitude for their valuable work.

** Whats next
Next I had to build the ssh honeypot and the HTTP honeypot, stay tuned for the
follow up!
