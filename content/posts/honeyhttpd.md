## I. Introduction {#i-dot-introduction}


### Brief overview of the use case: ingesting web data into Elasticsearch with HoneyPot HTTPD {#brief-overview-of-the-use-case-ingesting-web-data-into-elasticsearch-with-honeypot-httpd}

I recently set out to ingest web traffic data into our SIEM solution, which
requires data to be ingested in a specific format. After researching various
options, I sought an easy-to-use solution that could integrate with our
existing Elasticsearch setup. One tool that caught my attention was
HoneyPot HTTPD.

<!--more-->

As I researched potential solutions, I realized that many of them required
manual configuration and scripting to ingest web data into Elasticsearch.
However, HoneyPot HTTPD offered a simple and elegant way to do so through
its built-in ingestion feature. This was especially appealing since I wanted
to integrate the web traffic data with our existing SIEM setup that utilized
Elasticsearch.

<!--more-->

In particular, I needed a tool that could collect web traffic data and forward
it to a centralized location for analysis and processing. HoneyPot HTTPD's
ability to ingest web data into Elasticsearch made it an attractive choice,
as it would allow me to leverage our existing Elasticsearch infrastructure
and integrate the data with our SIEM solution seamlessly.

<!--more-->

With this in mind, I set out to explore how to use HoneyPot HTTPD to ingest
web traffic data into Elasticsearch. In the following sections, I'll walk
you through the steps I took to configure HoneyPot HTTPD for ingestion,
including the Dockerfile used to build the container and any additional
configuration settings required.

### Containerizing the application to run inside docker {#containerizing-the-application-to-run-inside-docker}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Creating a Dockerfile

    I started by creating a Dockerfile that would build the HoneHTTPD image.
    The Dockerfile included the following instructions:

    ```sh
    FROM ubuntu:latest
    # Install necessary dependencies
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip
    # Install required packages
    RUN pip3 install honeyhttpd
    # Set working directory to /usr/local/bin
    WORKDIR /usr/local/bin
    # Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
    EXPOSE 80
    # Copy configuration file
    COPY config.yaml /etc/honeyhttpd/
    # Run HoneyPot HTTPD
    CMD ["honeyhttpd", "-c", "/etc/honeyhttpd/config.yaml"]
    ```

    In this Dockerfile, I:

    -   Used the official Ubuntu image as the base image
    -   Installed necessary dependencies, including Python and pip
    -   Installed the required packages, including HoneyPot HTTPD
    -   Set the working directory to /usr/local/bin to run the application from
    -   Exposed port 80 for HTTP traffic
    -   Copied the configuration file (config.yaml) into the container
    -   Specified the command to run HoneyPot HTTPD with the -c option, which points
    -   to the configuration file

<!--list-separator-->

-  Building and Running the Container

    Once I had created the Dockerfile, I built the image by running
    the following command:

    ```sh
    docker build -t honeyhttpd .
    ```

    This command told Docker to create an image with the tag honeyhttpd using
    the instructions in the Dockerfile.To run the container, I used
    the following command:

    ```sh
    docker run -p 80:80 honeyhttpd
    ```

    This command started a new container from the honeyhttpd image and mapped
    port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the container.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Configuring the Container

    To configure the container, I updated the config.yaml file to point to
    my Elasticsearch instance. Here's an example of what the configuration
    file might look like:

    ```sh
    -ingest:
    es_host: "localhost:9200"
    es_index: "logstash-2019.04"
    es_type: "log"
    ```

    This configuration told HoneyPot HTTPD to forward web traffic data to
    my Elasticsearch instance, where it could be processed and stored.

    With the container running and configured, I was now ready to test
    HoneyPot HTTPD's ability to ingest web traffic data into Elasticsearch.
